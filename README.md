This repository contains two folders: slipping_sim and gait_optimization. All codes run in Matlab.

# Folder slipping_sim 
It provides the code to animate a feasible gait (obtained from no-slip rough surfaces) walking on slippery ground.

# Folder gait_optimization
It provides the code to obtain the most energetically-efficient gait with a speed specified.
